    "\n",
    "* Definition: Summary statistics are _numbers that summarize_ and provide information about your data.\n",
    "* A statistic is a numerical value that is computed from a sample of data.\n",
    "  * It's used to infer or estimate characteristics of the larger population from which the sample is drawn.\n",
    "* Summary statistics typically include measures of central tendency, measures of variability, and quantiles.\n"

    "### The Central Tendendcy\n",
    "* These are statistics that represent the center point or typical value of a dataset.\n",
    "  * They're like the 'average' values that summarize where most data points lie. \n",
    "  * The three main measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "* Mean: This is what most people think of as the average. \n",
    "  * For example, if your data is `[2, 3, 5]`, the mean is $(2+3+5)/3 = 3.33$.\n",
    "* Median: This is the middle value in your data when it is arranged in ascending order. \n",
    "  * For example, in the data `[2, 3, 5, 7]`, the median is $(3+5)/2 = 4$.\n",
    "* Mode: This is the number that appears most frequently in your data. \n",
    "  * For example, in `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the mode is `2`."

    "#### Measures of Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Location is just one dimension in summarizing a feature.\n",
    "* Variability, also referred to as dispersion, measures whether the data values are tightly grouped or spread out.\n",
    "  * Variability is a very important concept in statistics, especially in hypothesis testing and machine learning.\n",
    "* These statistics describe the spread or dispersion of your data, showing how much the data points differ from each other and from the central tendency measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: difference between the highest and lowest values in your dataset.\n",
    "  * For example, in [1, 2, 3, 10], the range is 10 - 1 = 9.\n",

    "* Variance: how much the data points differ from the mean.\n",
    "  * It's the average of the squared differences from the Mean. \n",

    "* Standard Deviation: the square root of the variance.\n",
    "  * It's widely used because it is in the same units as the data, making it easier to interpret.\n",
