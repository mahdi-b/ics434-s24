### 1_Introduction.ipynb
This notebook introduces the basics of data science, its origins, and its key components. Data science is an area that brings together methods from statistics and computer science to handle, analyze, and get insights from data.
The notebook covers the essential parts of data science: collecting data, preparing and cleaning it, exploring it to spot trends, building models to predict future trends, and visualizing data in clear and informative ways.

### 2_Intro_to_pandas_Python_package.ipynb
This notebook provides an overview of packages and modules in Python. It explains how packages are structured directories containing Python modules, which are individual Python files, and details how they can be imported and used to organize and reuse code efficiently in Python programming.


### 3_intro_to_pandas.ipynb
This notebook introduces Pandas, the leading library for data wrangling. Specifically, the notebook introduces two pivotal data structures essential for data wrangling (Series and DataFrames), and provides an in-depth exploration of indexing techniques for efficient data handling.

### 4_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to exploratory data analysis using Pandas. We start by exploring general dataset attributes, such as the number of rows and columns, and understanding column data types. The notebook then delves into methods for invoking descriptive statistics operations, such as calculating the mean and median, and describes the concept of axis in Pandas operations. The notebook also describes how missing values are handled  and provides insights into sorting data and concludes with practical examples of using basic Pandas plots for data visualization.


## 5_arithmetic_ops_and_data_alignment.ipynb
This notebook provides a thorough overview of vectorization in Pandas and demonstrates the efficiency of vectorized operations over traditional loops, the concept of broadcasting in array manipulation, and how to apply arithmetic and comparison operations effectively in Pandas. Additionally, the notebook covers data querying and subsetting, highlighting the ease and speed of handling large datasets with these techniques.
